# Advent of Code 2022

## Running

As I have zero idea what I'm doing with python modules, to run this you have to do something like `py -m src.day_01.script`, else it won't find the utils module.

## Notes

Remember to include the `..` with `..utils.input`, which doesn't throw an error if ignored, but won't work.

## Conclusion

Damn I'm bad at python.
